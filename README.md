# Rain
Rain is 2D game developed in pure Java, without use of any external libraries / game engines. It is similiar to Realm of the Mad God.

Still in early implementations, I'm following along a course and implementing my own version as I learn.

Features (Implemented / Upcoming):
Events, Logging Systems, Mobs / NPCs, Mob AI, Rendering techniques, Buffer strategies, Collision detections, particle simulations, 
UI & Multiplayer approach
